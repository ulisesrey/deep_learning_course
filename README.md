# Deep Learning Course
This repository contains some exercices I solved with Deep Learning tools during the Deep Learning course at the Data Science Master at UOC.

## 1.
## 2.
## 3.
## 4. GANs for image generation
In this genAI project I trained two neuronal networks to generate images of numbers. In the first one, two adversarial networks are trained against each other to generate images that ressemble numbers. The second one is a condiotional GAN with labels to have a generative Network that can generate images of specific numbers. [Link to notebook](GANs/genAI_gans.ipynb)/[html](GANs/genAI_gans.html)


Tools: GANs, Conditional GANs, Keras




Note: This repository contains the final version of the exercises. The commit history of the progress is in a private repository.
