# Deep Learning Course
This repository contains some exercices I solved with Deep Learning tools during the Deep Learning course at the Data Science Master at UOC.

## 1.
## 2.
## 3.
## 4. GANs for image generation
In this genAI project I trained two neuronal networks. The first one a GAN to generate images that ressemble numbers. The second one a condiotional GAN with labels to have a generative Network that can generate images of specific numbers. [Link to notebook].ipynb)/[html](.html)
